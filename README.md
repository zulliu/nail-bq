# Nail-BQ: Behavioral Question Prompter

Nail-BQ is a mini app designed to assist job seekers in preparing for interviews by providing randomized behavioral questions for practice. With a diverse set of questions, categorized by different professional fields and tags, users can simulate the unpredictability of actual interviews and prepare responses accordingly. Check the [Demo](http://ec2-13-52-185-193.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5173/) here.

## Features

- **Randomized Questions**: Generates behavioral questions at random, so you never know what's coming next, just like in a real interview.
- **Question Filters**: Allows users to filter questions based on specific fields and tags, tailoring the practice session to specific job requirements or industries.
- **Answer Timer**: Includes a timer feature for users to track how long they take to answer each question, helping to improve response times.
- **Hints**: Offers hints for each question, giving users a nudge towards what interviewers might be looking for in responses.
